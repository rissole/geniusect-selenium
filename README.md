# Geniusect

Geniusect is (currently planned) to be a three-component project, including a data gatherer (TBA), AI (TBA), and battle automator (this project) for the Pokemon Showdown website.

Geniusect-selenium is based on the Java Selenium WebDriver 2.28.0, and provides a library of functions for interacting with the Pokemon Showdown website through Selenium.

## Usage
* Download and extract the [Java Selenium Client WebDriver 2.28.0](http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-java-2.28.0.zip).
* Add `selenium-java-2.28.0.jar` and all jars in the `libs` folder as project dependencies.

## Documentation
All library functions are (or will be) well documented with function header comments. For general Selenium documention and getting started guide, see [the Selenium documentation](http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp).

Additionally an Example.java is provided which contains a well commented example script using the Showdown Selenium helper functions.
